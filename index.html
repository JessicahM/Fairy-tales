      <p>Fairy World is where most fairies live, aside from those acting as Fairy Godparents on Earth. The strongest fairy in the universe, Jorgen Von Strangle, is one of the residents here. Fairy World is balanced by a number of gigantic rules aside from the godparent rulebook. Some other residents of Fairy World include Big Daddy, Mama Cosma, Binky, Simon Sparklefield, the Tooth Fairy and Blonda.</p>
      <p>Fairy World is located on clouds up in the heavens. The roads are rainbows, as well as the bridge down to Earth, The bridge is unnecessary since most Fairies simply teleport to and from Earth. Most buildings have a fairy crown above the roofs. It is not actually a part of Earth, but is depicted as a separate world near Earth orbit that can only be accessed by magic.</p>

      <h2>Origin of Fairies</h2>
      <div class="unspank">
      <p>Most of us think of fairies as tiny creatures, flitting about on gossamer wings, waving a magic wand, but history and folklore tell a different tale.
      When belief in fairies was common most people didn't like to mention them by name and so referred to them by other names: the Little People or the Hidden People.
      Many explanations have been given for a belief in fairies. Some say that they are like ghosts, spirits of the dead, or were fallen angels, neither bad enough for Hell nor good enough for Heaven.
      There are hundreds of different kinds of fairies - some are minute creatures, others grotesque - some can fly, and all can appear and disappear at will.The oldest fairies on record in England were first described by the historian Gervase of Tilbury in the 13th century.</p>
      <p>Brownies and other hobgoblins (pictured right) are guardian fairies. They are useful ones and do housework and odd jobs around the house. In Aberdeenshire, Scotland  they are hideous to look at, they have no separate toes or fingers and in the Scottish Lowlands they have a hole instead of a nose! Banshees are less common and more sinister, they usually only appear to foretell a tragedy. In Highland tradition the Washer-by-the-Ford, a web footed, one nostrilled, buck toothed hag is only seen washing blood-stained clothes when men are about to meet a violent death</p>

      <h2>Types of Fairies</h2>
        <ul>
        <h3><strong>The well known Pixie</strong></h3>

        <li>This small, winged fairy has a human-type form and at its tallest is only 6” tall. Pixies are quite attracted to small children, Spirit of the Night AMKlaughter, and happiness. They love gardens (especially Heather) and other flowering plants.  Like hummingbirds, they are known to sip nectar from flowers like Honeysuckle.  Fun loving, carefree and prankish, they often take household items from humans only to return them later when they’ve had their fun. They are more  spontaneous and active than their larger fairy counterparts and generally have a shorter attention span.  They are very social beings and live in a monarchy under a king or queen.</li>
        <h3><strong>Trooping Fairies</strong></h3>

        <li>These fairies are generally the same size as pixies (6” trooping_fairies1tall) but have no wings. They are known as trooping fairies because they travel together in long processions.  The males often wear green jackets and they tend live near the woods where there is a lot of underbrush.  They are also  known to inhabit trees often referred to by humans as a “fairy tree.” Trooping fairies can be larger or smaller than 6” and can be friendly or sinister.</li>

        <h3><strong>Brownies</strong></h3>

        <li>At  4.5 tall , they are a bit smaller than pixies brownies1and trooping fairies.  Brownies wear brown clothing, are very meticulous and tend to have a darker brown skin color.  They have no wings but are quite capable of getting to high places by each one climbing on to the other to boost each other up.  These intelligent and good natured fairies originated in Scotland and are known as household fairies, meaning they reside within the home and often do chores to help out a deserving human family in exchange for food and other offerings.  They are nocturnal.</li>
    <h3><strong>Fauns</strong></h3>
    <img src="http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/548824-wsl_fauna.jpg">
    <li>A creature of the woodland forests, the faun has horns on his d_lathrop_pan1head and a body that resembles a goat below the waist and a human above.  Fauns tend to be alluring, seductive and compelling, often preying upon the unsuspecting by using mind control and magic conjured from their pipes or flute to get what they desire from their victim.  According to the elves, if one sees a faun, avert your eyes because as soon as they have your attention, you are under their control.  That’s why humans have depicted satan to be a faun.  They are neutral but can be very dangerous.</li>
  </ul>
   <h3>About the Authors</h3>
     <p>We are thrown into the midst of a story we don’t fully understand. We understand that there is good and evil and we are caught somewhere in between those two forces. But that is about it.We sense that there is conflict and hardship that must be overcome. We know that greatness is being demanded of us.This is the setting for many fairy tales. Everything begins somewhat serenely, but soon you notice that all is not well.There is a curse in the land that must be broken or an enemy force gathering strength some underlying tension that you can sense in the story. And it is soon to emerge. And thats why we love them soo soo much:)</p>
